## Business Case for an Air Pollution Dashboard for Bicycle Commuters in NYC

### Executive Summary

Air quality is a significant concern for New York City (NYC) residents, especially bicycle commuters who are directly exposed to pollutants while navigating the city's streets. An air pollution dashboard, aimed at providing real-time, hyper-local air quality data, offers a solution that serves both bicycle commuters and public officials. The dashboard will be fueled by sensor data collected through a network of citizen cyclists and strategically placed sensors across the city.

This business case outlines three core components:
1. **Providing real-time air pollution data to bicycle commuters** to help them choose the cleanest air routes.
2. **Selling air pollution sensors** to bicyclists, allowing them to access the best real-time data from their own sensors while contributing to the city-wide pollution map.
3. **Supplying high-quality pollution data to public officials**, enabling them to assess the impact of policies on air quality and public health.

### Problem Statement

NYC's dense urban environment subjects its residents to varying levels of air pollution, which are often localized. Bicycle commuters are particularly vulnerable due to their close proximity to vehicular traffic, especially in congested areas. Currently, there is no easily accessible platform that provides real-time pollution data mapped onto cycling routes, making it difficult for cyclists to select cleaner, safer routes.

Additionally, public officials and policy-makers lack detailed, localized pollution data to measure the effectiveness of air quality improvement policies and communicate the impact of their decisions to the public.

### Proposed Solution

The air pollution dashboard provides a solution by integrating real-time data collected from distributed air pollution sensors and visualizing it on a map tailored for bicycle commuters. This approach offers:
- **Real-time route planning for cyclists**: Cyclists can access clean air routes based on hyper-local, real-time data from pollution sensors distributed across the city.
- **Crowdsourced data enhancement**: Bicyclists who purchase pollution sensors can not only benefit from real-time data but also contribute to the network, improving the city's overall air quality map.
- **Policy impact tracking**: Public officials gain access to comprehensive data to track air quality trends, helping to demonstrate how specific policies are improving public health outcomes.

### Benefits

#### 1. **For Bicycle Commuters**
- **Health-conscious route selection**: Cyclists can avoid the most polluted streets and select cleaner, healthier routes, reducing their exposure to harmful pollutants.
- **Real-time data access**: Cyclists with sensors can visualize air quality data while riding, enabling informed, in-the-moment decisions about route adjustments.
- **Community-driven improvement**: Cyclists' sensor data enriches the overall dashboard, allowing the entire cycling community to benefit from more accurate and localized pollution data.

#### 2. **For Public Officials**
- **Data-driven policy decisions**: Detailed air quality data helps officials better understand localized pollution sources, enabling more targeted policy interventions.
- **Public health communication**: With improved data, officials can clearly communicate how policy changes are impacting air quality, helping to bolster public support for initiatives.
- **Accountability and transparency**: Access to real-time air quality data enhances transparency, demonstrating the city's commitment to reducing pollution and improving public health.

#### 3. **Revenue Opportunities**
- **Sensor sales to cyclists**: By selling sensors to cyclists, the business generates revenue while simultaneously growing the cityâ€™s pollution monitoring network.
- **Data monetization**: Beyond cyclists, the comprehensive dataset can be licensed to third parties (e.g., urban planners, health organizations) for research or policy-making purposes.
- **Subscription model for advanced features**: Cyclists can subscribe to premium features, such as detailed historical data, predictive route planning based on pollution forecasts, and enhanced analytics.

### Market Opportunity

NYC has over 1 million cyclists, with numbers growing steadily as the city continues to expand its bicycle infrastructure. With increasing awareness of air quality concerns, particularly in urban environments, there is a significant market for a product that combines real-time air quality data with cycling route planning.

In addition, local government agencies are continually seeking better data to inform environmental and public health policies. Providing a localized, data-driven solution enhances both the city's appeal to cyclists and its capability to drive meaningful policy improvements.

### Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: Sensor Deployment and Dashboard Development**
   - Collaborate with environmental organizations to strategically place initial air pollution sensors in key cycling areas.
   - Build and launch a beta version of the dashboard, allowing cyclists to access real-time data and test route planning features.

2. **Phase 2: Crowdsourced Data Expansion**
   - Begin selling air pollution sensors to bicyclists through direct-to-consumer channels (e.g., online stores, bike shops).
   - Promote the benefits of contributing to a crowdsourced air quality map, incentivizing sensor purchases.

3. **Phase 3: Public Policy Integration**
   - Partner with city agencies to supply pollution data for policy analysis and health outcome tracking.
   - Develop public-facing reports that show the relationship between policies (e.g., low-emission zones) and improved air quality.

### Risks and Mitigation

- **Risk: Sensor accuracy and reliability**: If the sensors provided to cyclists are inaccurate or unreliable, it could compromise the entire dataset.
  - **Mitigation**: Partner with a trusted sensor manufacturer to ensure high-quality, reliable sensors that provide accurate readings.

- **Risk: Limited adoption by cyclists**: If too few cyclists purchase sensors, the data quality may be insufficient to drive meaningful insights.
  - **Mitigation**: Provide incentives for early adopters, such as discounted sensors and premium dashboard access.

- **Risk: Data privacy concerns**: Users may be wary of sharing location data related to their bike routes.
  - **Mitigation**: Implement robust privacy controls, giving cyclists full control over how their data is used and shared.

### Conclusion

The air pollution dashboard is a timely and impactful solution that addresses the growing concerns of air quality in NYC. By providing bicycle commuters with real-time data, empowering cyclists to contribute to the broader data ecosystem, and supplying valuable insights to public officials, this business venture is positioned to improve public health, promote sustainable transportation, and drive revenue through sensor sales and data monetization.
